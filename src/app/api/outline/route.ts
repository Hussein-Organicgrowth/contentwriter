			When writing in Danish, ensure the following rules are adhered to:
	   
	   Verb Conjugation in Present Tense:
	   
	   Add "-r" to the infinitive form of verbs to form the present tense.
	   Example: "at lære" becomes "jeg lærer."
	   Distinguishing "nogle" and "nogen":
	   
	   Use "nogle" when referring to multiple people or things. Example: "Nogle mennesker har nemt ved grammatik."
	   Use "nogen" in questions, negatives, or conditionals. Example: "Er der nogen, der kan forklare mig reglerne?"
	   Compound Words:
	   
	   Combine words if the emphasis is on the first part (e.g., "Dansklærer" for a Danish teacher).
	   Keep them separate if the emphasis is on the second part (e.g., "dansk lærer" for a teacher from Denmark).
	   Endings "-ende" vs. "-ene":
	   
	   Use "-ende" for present participles (verbs), e.g., "løbende."
	   Use "-ene" for definite plural nouns, e.g., "løbene."
	   Pronoun Usage:
	   
	   Use "jeg" as the subject. Example: "Laura og jeg spiser aftensmad."
	   Use "mig" as the object. Example: "Mads bad Laura og mig om at spise aftensmad."
	   Noun Genders and Articles:
	   
	   Common gender nouns use "en," and neuter nouns use "et."
	   Examples: "en bil" (a car) and "et hus" (a house).
	   Definite Nouns:
	   
	   Add "-en" for common gender nouns and "-et" for neuter nouns to make them definite.
	   Examples: "bilen" (the car) and "huset" (the house).
	   Adjective Agreement:
	   
	   Match adjectives to the gender and number of the noun they describe.
	   Examples: "en stor dreng" (a big boy) vs. "et stort hus" (a big house).
	   Word Order:
	   
	   Follow Subject-Verb-Object order, but ensure the verb is in the second position in main clauses (V2 word order).
	   Capitalization:
	   
	   Capitalize only proper nouns and the first word of a sentence.
	   Example: Days, months, and nationalities are lowercase: "mandag," "juli," "dansk."

					Your task is to create an SEO-optimized outline that:
					- Follows the skyscraper technique to outperform competitor content
					- Implements strategic keyword placement in headers
					- Addresses user search intent comprehensively
					- Creates a content hierarchy that search engines can easily understand
					- Includes semantic SEO elements and related topics
					- Maintains optimal content depth for the target keyword
					- Ensures proper keyword distribution across sections

					SEO Optimization Guidelines:
					- H2 headers should include primary or secondary keywords when natural
					- H3 headers should target long-tail variations and related questions
					- Include sections for featured snippet opportunities
					- Structure content to target "People Also Ask" opportunities
					- Add sections for key statistics and data points
					- Include comparison sections when relevant
					- Plan for rich media placement (images, videos, tables)

					Formatting Requirements:
					- Use H2 for main sections (primary keyword focus)
					- Use H3 for subsections (secondary keyword focus)
					- Follow this format exactly:
					  H2: Main Section (with keyword)
					  H3: Subsection (with related term)
					  H4: Detailed Point (with specific focus)

					Content Structure Rules:
					- Each line must start with the header level (H2:, H3:)
					- H3 sections must follow an H2 section
					- Include an FAQ section for featured snippet targeting
					- Add comparison sections when relevant
					- Include data/statistics sections for backlink potential
					- Maintain proper keyword density in headers
					- Follow E-E-A-T principles in structure

					Required Sections:
					- Introduction (with featured snippet target)
					- Main topic sections (with keyword variations)
					- Practical examples or case studies
					- Expert insights or analysis
					- FAQ section (targeting "People Also Ask")
					- Conclusion with key takeaways

					Output Example (Strictly Follow This Format):
					H2: [Primary Keyword]: Complete Guide for [Current Year]

					H3: Why [Primary Keyword] Matters in [Industry/Context]
					H2: [Secondary Keyword]: Essential Components
					H3: Top [Number] [Related Keyword] Strategies
