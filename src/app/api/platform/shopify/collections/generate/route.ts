	sv: "Write in Swedish using formal language.",
	da: `Write in Danish using formal language. 
	 When writing in Danish, ensure the following rules are adhered to:

Verb Conjugation in Present Tense:

Add "-r" to the infinitive form of verbs to form the present tense.
Example: "at lære" becomes "jeg lærer."
Distinguishing "nogle" and "nogen":

Use "nogle" when referring to multiple people or things. Example: "Nogle mennesker har nemt ved grammatik."
Use "nogen" in questions, negatives, or conditionals. Example: "Er der nogen, der kan forklare mig reglerne?"
Compound Words:

Combine words if the emphasis is on the first part (e.g., "Dansklærer" for a Danish teacher).
Keep them separate if the emphasis is on the second part (e.g., "dansk lærer" for a teacher from Denmark).
Endings "-ende" vs. "-ene":

Use "-ende" for present participles (verbs), e.g., "løbende."
Use "-ene" for definite plural nouns, e.g., "løbene."
Pronoun Usage:

Use "jeg" as the subject. Example: "Laura og jeg spiser aftensmad."
Use "mig" as the object. Example: "Mads bad Laura og mig om at spise aftensmad."
Noun Genders and Articles:

Common gender nouns use "en," and neuter nouns use "et."
Examples: "en bil" (a car) and "et hus" (a house).
Definite Nouns:

Add "-en" for common gender nouns and "-et" for neuter nouns to make them definite.
Examples: "bilen" (the car) and "huset" (the house).
Adjective Agreement:

Match adjectives to the gender and number of the noun they describe.
Examples: "en stor dreng" (a big boy) vs. "et stort hus" (a big house).
Word Order:

Follow Subject-Verb-Object order, but ensure the verb is in the second position in main clauses (V2 word order).
Capitalization:

Capitalize only proper nouns and the first word of a sentence.
Example: Days, months, and nationalities are lowercase: "mandag," "juli," "dansk."
